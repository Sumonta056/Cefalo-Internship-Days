# Documentation for Daily Activity Tracker Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

The Daily Activity Tracker is a machine learning-based application designed to monitor and analyze personal habits throughout the workday using the laptop's camera. It tracks activities such as work sessions, breaks, coffee consumption, meals, and other behaviors. The primary purpose is to generate a personalized, private end-of-day report for self-reflection and productivity analysis.

## Key Features

1. Activity Recognition:

   - Identifies and counts coffee consumption.
   - Tracks time spent away from the desk.
   - Logs active work sessions and breaks.
   - Detects meal times based on user behavior.

2. Real-time Monitoring:

   - Continuously captures video data to analyze activities.
   - Processes frames to detect key actions like sitting, eating, or drinking.

3. End-of-Day Report:

   - Summarizes the number of work sessions, breaks, meals, and drinks.
   - Provides timestamps and duration for each activity.

4. Privacy First:

   - Ensures data stays local to the user's device.
   - Does not upload or share images, video, or activity logs with any external servers.

## Suggested Additional Features

1.  Advanced Analytics:

    - Include graphs or charts for trends over days, weeks, or months.
    - Offer productivity insights, such as the longest uninterrupted work session.

2.  AI-Powered Notifications:

    - Suggest breaks when prolonged activity is detected.
    - Recommend hydration after tracking a long period without drinks.

3.  Personalized Goals:

    - Allow users to set goals for work hours, break frequency, or meal times.
    - Track progress toward these goals.

4.  Multiple Device Integration:

    - Sync with smartphones or smartwatches for cross-device activity logging.

5.  Facial Expression Analysis:
    - Monitor stress or fatigue levels based on facial expressions during work sessions.

## Technical Implementation

1. Languages and Tools:

- Python: For machine learning and backend development.
- OpenCV: For real-time image and video analysis.
- TensorFlow/PyTorch: For activity recognition models.
- Django/Flask: For building the user interface.
- SQLite: For local storage of activity logs.

2. Model Training:

- Collect labeled data of activities such as drinking coffee, eating, and working.
- Train a classification model for activity recognition using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

3. Security Measures:

- Encrypt local storage to secure activity logs.
- Use secure access protocols to ensure only the user can view the data.
- Enable a feature to delete all stored data on user request.

4. User Interface:

- Dashboard with a summary of activities.
- Options to configure privacy settings and customize reports.

## Security Concerns

1. Data Privacy:

- Ensure all data processing occurs locally.
- Do not include cloud storage unless explicitly enabled by the user with encryption.

2. User Consent:

- Inform users about data usage and request consent for camera access.

3. Secure Local Storage:

- Use strong encryption for any locally stored files or reports.
- Restrict access to sensitive data with a password or biometric lock.

## Script for Presentation

> “Imagine an AI assistant that tracks your daily work habits without compromising your privacy. My project, the Daily Activity Tracker, uses machine learning to monitor your activities through your laptop camera, giving you insights into your work sessions, breaks, and coffee habits. At the end of each day, you’ll receive a comprehensive report showing how your day was spent—just for your eyes. With advanced analytics, personalized goals, and privacy as the top priority, this tool is here to help you understand and optimize your productivity while ensuring all your data stays with you, securely.”
